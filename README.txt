This is the Matlab code for absolute camera pose estimation from line correspondences using Direct Linear Transformation. The theory and background is described in our paper "Přibyl, Bronislav and Zemčík, Pavel and Čadík, Martin: Absolute Pose Estimation from Line Correspondences using Direct Linear Transformation". https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06891

The proposed method DLT-Combined-Lines is implemented in file "DLT_Combined_Lines.m".


=== AVAILABLE TESTS ============================================================

* test_simple5.m
  - A minimal working example.
  - The DLT-Combined-Lines method is run on 5 predefined lines.
  
* test_random.m
  - All methods can be run on randomly generated lines.
  
* test_outliers.m
  - All methods can be run on randomly generated lines with outlying correspondences.
  
* test_VGG.m
  - All methods can be run on real-world image sequences from the VGG multiview dataset.
  - Please uncomment the dataset of your choice at the beginning of the script.
  
* test_MPI.m
  - All methods can be run on real-world image sequences from the MPI datasets for Reconstruction of 3D Line Segment from Images.
  - Please uncomment the dataset of your choice at the beginning of the script.
